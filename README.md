# Unusual Windows MIDIs (UnusualWM)

These .mid files was obtained from various versions of Windows (95/2000/ME/etc.) to prevent from being lost, once for all.

It doesn't include RMI Classical files for non-historical reasons.

It includes pre-rendered MP3 files made using Roland SC-55 Soundfont v3.7 by EmperorGrieferus, for those don't know how to open MIDI files.

Clouds was used as a part of the easter egg, *The Microsoft Windows 95 Development Team!*, but it was uploaded regardless.
